GtkPlot
=======

GtkPlot is a widget for GTK+. It allows to draw high quality scientific
plots in two dimensions with a look and feel very similar to Microcal 
Origin for Windows. The distribution includes GtkPlotLayout, a simple
GtkLayout subclass, and a demo program showing two layered plots 
with different kind of curves. You can choose between a number
of symbol types, lines, connectors -straight lines, steps, splines-, and
change their attributes -color, size, width-. You can also plot functions, 
add error bars, edit legends, rotate and move axis titles, change axis
properties, etc.   

GtkPlot-2.x includes a GtkPlotCanvas widget which allows DnD plots, points, and
child objects (text, axis titles). You can move them or resize your plots
dragging with the mouse! 

GtkPlot-3.x includes a PostScript driver. 

You can download the package from:
