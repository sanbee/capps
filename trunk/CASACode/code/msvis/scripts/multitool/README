All of the files in this directory contain sample scripts that use more
then one of the plotting tools on the same plot -- how cool!

The scripts typically make use of the CASA mp, cp, and tp tools rather
then the plotxy and plotcal tasks.

If you have a cool script that you would like to add to the repository
please send an email to ???.
