%N timager
	
	Program to drive the image deconvolution algorithms
        implemented in AIPS++/CASA.  This can also be used to predict
        visibilities for a given sky model.  Predicted visibilities
        can include various instrumental/geometric effects depending
        on the ftmachine used.

	algorithm.  This can be used in conjunction with wproject to
	use faceted imaging with w-projection.


%A wplanes (default=1)

	Number of pixel along the w-axis.  A convolution function is
	computed for each w-pixel.  The run-time memory requirement is

	read from the pointing offsets table given by the

	attenuation before being used for predicting the
	visibilities.
 
	For iterative deconvolution, this should always be 1.  When

	should be set to 0, if the model image does not include
	primary beam attenuation.

	offsets as a function of time.

	intermediate image model.

                        upon the values of imnchan, imstart and

	An un-normalized (YUCK!) fudge factor to control when a minor
