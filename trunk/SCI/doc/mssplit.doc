%N mssplit
	
        Split a subset of the data as an independent MS from the
        input MS.  The splitted MS can be a reference MS (a
        lightweight copy) or a deep-copy MS.

%A ms (default=)

	The input MS.


%A outms (default=)

	The output MS name.  If left blank, no disk file for the
        output will be produced.


%A deepcopy (default=0)

	If set to 1, the output MS will be a deep copy (i.e. it will
        be independent of the parent input MS).  If set to 0, the
        output MS will be a referenced MS (i.e., it will depend on the
        parent input MS, but will be a light weight copy).

        
%A field (default=)

	The Field selection expression.  Default implies all fields
        will be included in the output MS.


%A time (default=)

	Time selection expression.  Default implies all time-stamps
        will be included in the output MS.


%A spw (default=)

	The spectral window selection expression.  Default implies that all
        spectral windows will be included in the output MS.


%A baseline (default=)

	Baseline selection expression.  Default implies that all
        baselines will be included in the output MS.


%A scan (default=)

	Scan selection expression.  Default implies that all scans
        will be included in the output MS.


%A array (default=)

	Sub-array selection expression.  Default implies that all
        sub-arrays will be included in the output MS.


%A uvdist (default=)

	UV-distance selection expression.  Default implies that the
        entire available uv-range will be included in the output MS.


%A taql (default=)

	***This keyword is exposed with a command-line argument of "help=dbg"***

        A TaQL expression that will be used, along with other
        selection expressions, to select the data for the output MS.
