%A ms (default=)

	Name of the input Measurement Set.


%A model (default=)

	Name of the input image model.


%A incal (default=)

	Name of the input calibration table. This will be
        applied to the data before solving for the calibration
        term.


%A outcal (default=)

	Name of the output calibration table.


%A integ (default=0)

	Integration time in seconds.
        0 ==> scan averaging.


%A nchan (default=1)

	Number of channels to average before passing the
        data to the solver.


%A start (default=0)

	Start channel.


%A step (default=1)

	Channel step.


%A type (default=EP)

        The calibration type to solve for.

	This keyword exposes the following keywords:
        Value      Keywords exposed
         EP         cfcache painc 

%A cfcache (default=)

	Name of the disk cache directory for caching the
        convolution function when solving for EP.

%A painc (default=1)

	Parallactic Angle increment to be used when solving
        for EP.

%A field (default=)

	Field selection expression.  By default, select all 
        fields.

%A spw (default=)

	Spectral Window selection expression.  By default select
        all spectral windows.

%A uvrange (default=)

	UV-range to be used when solving.


%A antenna (default=)

	Antennas for which the solutions are saught.


%A time (default=)

	Time range for which the solution is saught.


%A gain (default=0.1)

	***This keyword is exposed with a command-line argument of "help=dbg"***

	Loop gain for the interative solver.

%A niter (default=100)

	***This keyword is exposed with a command-line argument of "help=dbg"***

        Maximum number of iterations of the iterative solver.

%A tolerance (default=1e-07)

	***This keyword is exposed with a command-line argument of "help=dbg"***

        The tolerance used to terminate the iterations.

%A wplanes (default=1)

	***This keyword is exposed with a command-line argument of "help=dbg"***
  
        Number of w-terms to be used when solving for EP for data with
        significant non-coplanar errors.
