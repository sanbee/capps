I have found a solution... but there's room for improvement.  Use
gtk_signal_connect() to connect to the gtkplotcanvas "expose_event".  Within
your signal handler use gtk_plot_canvas_set_size() to reset the size,
however, this function will also set the usize (aka the minimum widget size)
of the gtkplotcanvas.  When it does this you won't be able to shrink your
window.  So use gtk_widget_set_usize() to reset the usize to whatever
minimum size you want.  That's it.  In short;

1.) create a signal handler for the "expose_event"
2.) use gtk_plot_canvas_set_size() to reset the widget size
3.) use gtk_widget_set_usize() to reset the minimum widget size

The one thing I don't like about this approach is that the graph get draw
twice.  The first drawing is done at it's original size.  The second drawing
is done at the new size.  If I figure out how to fix this I'll post
something on the mailing lists.
