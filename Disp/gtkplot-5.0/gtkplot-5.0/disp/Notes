XYPanel::Plot calls the following:

      gtk_plot_paint(GTK_WIDGET(CHART),&area);
      // gtk_plot_refresh(GTK_PLOT(CHART),&area);
      gtk_plot_layout_refresh(GTK_PLOT_LAYOUT(Canvas));

Unless gtk_plot_layout_refresh() is called, dynamic chanage of axis limits,
e.g., does not clear-n-redraw the axis labels.  With this call it
does, but internally, it re-draws all the panels (even if the limits
of only one panel are changed).  This must be made to take "area"
and only that area is refreshed.  Or somehow told which panel to refresh.
