	<description>

       Bootstrap the flux density scale from standard calibrators:

       After running gaincal on standard flux density calibrators (with or
       without a model), and other calibrators with unknown flux densities,
       fluxscale will determine the flux density of the unknowns calibrators
       that are most consistent with the standard calibrator antenna gains.

<example>

       After running gaincal on standard flux density calibrators (with or
       without a model), and other calibrators with unknown flux densities,
       fluxscale will determine the flux density of the unknowns calibrators
       that are most consistent with the standard calibrator antenna gains.

       Check the log output to make sure that reasonable flux densities are
       obtained.

       Keyword arguments:
       vis -- Name of input visibility file
               default: none; example: vis='ngc5921.ms'
       caltable -- Name of input calibration table
               default: none; example: caltable='ngc5921.gcal'
               This cal table was obtained from task gaincal.
       fluxtable -- Name of output, flux-scaled calibration table
               default: none; example: fluxtable='ngc5921.gcal2'
               The gains in this table have been adjusted by the
               derived flux density each calibrator.  The MODEL_DATA
               column has NOT been updated for the flux density of the
               calibrator.  Use setjy to do this if it is a point source.
       reference -- Reference field name(s)
               The names of the fields with a known flux densities or
                  visibilties that have been placed in the MODEL column
                  by setjy or ft for a model not in the CASA system.
               The syntax is similar to field.  Hence field index or
                  names can be used.
               default: none; example: reference='1328+307'
       transfer -- Transfer field name(s)
               The names of the fields with unknown flux densities.
                  These should be point-like calibrator sources
               The syntax is similar to field.  Hence source index or
                 names can be used.
               default: '' = all sources in caltable that are not specified
                  as reference sources.  Do not include unknown target sources
               example: transfer='1445+099, 3C84'; transfer = '0,4'

               NOTE: All fields in reference and transfer must have solutions
               in the caltable.

       append -- Append fluxscaled solutions to the fluxtable.
               default: False; (will overwrite if already existing)
               example: append=True
       refspwmap -- Vector of spectral windows enablings scaling across
               spectral windows
               default: [-1]==> none.
               Example with 4 spectral windows:
               if the reference fields were observed only in spw=1 &amp; 3,
               and the transfer fields were observed in all 4 spws (0,1,2,3),
               specify refspwmap=[1,1,3,3].
               This will ensure that transfer fields observed in spws 0,1,2,3
               will be referenced to reference field solutions only in
               spw 1 or 3.
