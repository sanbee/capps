{BETA ALERT:} These tend to become out of date as we add new tasks
or change names.

{BETA ALERT:} This link is out-of-date and refers mostly to the 
Toolkit.  We will update this with a task dictionary.

\section{MIRIAD -- CASA dictionary}
\label{section:dict.miriad}

Table~\ref{table:miriad} provides a list of common Miriad tasks, and their
equivalent CASA tool or tool function names. The two packages differ
in both their architecture and calibration and imaging models, and
there is often not a direct correspondence. However, this index does
provide a scientific user of CASA who is familiar with MIRIAD, with
a simple translation table to map their existing data reduction
knowledge to the new package.

\section{CLIC -- CASA dictionary}
\label{section:dict.clic}

Table~\ref{table:clic} provides a list of common CLIC tasks, and their
equivalent CASA tool or tool function names. The two packages are
very similar since the CASA software to reduce IRAM data is based
on the CLIC reduction procedures.
