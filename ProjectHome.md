A simple interface to [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/) applications.  These are stand-alone applications which provides easy access to the scientific functionality available in [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/) core and synthesis libraries.  The applications use the [parafeed](http://code.google.com/p/parafeed/) libraries for an embedded interactive and non-interactive user interface.  The applications can also be run in a non-interactive mode from scripts.
